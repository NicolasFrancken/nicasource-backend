Hi NicaSource, here is my proyect!
To start the backend you'll have to download it and run "npm install".
Then, you'll have to create a .env file with this structure ->

DB_USER = yourusername

DB_PASSWORD = yourpassword

DB_HOST = localhost

DB_PORT = 5432

DB_DATABASE = nicasourcedb

DB_POSTGRESDATABASE = postgres

SECRET_KEY=super_secret_key

PORT = 5000

After saving it, you'll be able to start the server with "npx tsc" and then "node build/server.js"

It will create a database for you!

Hope you like it!

If you have any questions, or something does not work as expected, call me: +542944959344 or write me an email: franckennicolas@gmail.com

At the moment of publishing it, everything works great!
